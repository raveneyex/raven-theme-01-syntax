# raven-warm-syntax theme

Dark syntax theme with warm colors for highlights, and pretty fonts.

I know that Atom *hates* when you include `font-family` in the theme's styles, but to use the particular fonts listed below is the sole reason of existence for this theme.)

## Fonts
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [flottflott](http://www.dafont.com/flottflott.font)
